## Usage

First select in a "Commands" selector an item "Watch visible area". Then select an item "State of flights". This begins a process of collection and display information of flights in the visible area. Black icons means aircrafts on the ground, green ones - the descending aircrafts and blue -  the climbing. Subsequent changes or shifts of a window do not change of the area under control.
To do this execute the "Watch visible area" command once more in needed place.

Command "Intersection" calculates aircrafts that intersect in 6 minutes on a distance less then 400 meters (altitude differense less than 10000 feet). If you click on a link between aircrafts you know accurate values.

Click on an aircraft icon brings up a popup with general data of a flight and two buttons. Button "Inform" provides a popup with detailed information of the flight. Button "Trail" draws a current way of the aircraft.
