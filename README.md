## Usage

First select in a "Commands" selector an item "Watch visible area". Then select an item "State of flights". This begins a process of collection and display information of flights in the visible area. Black icons means aircrafts on the ground, green ones are descending, blue ones are climbing and purple - on level flight. Subsequent changes or shifts of a window do not change of the area under control.
To do this execute the "Watch visible area" command again in needed place.

Command "Intersection" calculates aircrafts that intersect in 6 minutes on a distance less then 400 meters (altitude differense less than 10000 feet). If you click on a link between aircrafts you know accurate values.

Click on an aircraft icon brings up a popup with general data of a flight and 4 buttons. Button "Inform" provides a popup with detailed information of the flight. Button "Trail" draws a current way of the aircraft. Button "Follow" starts moving of the visible area along this flight and periodically displays a trail of the flight. Button "Stop" ends up this moving.

Using the command "Move to Airport" you can instantly shift to some other airport. First select a country and then an airport in this country.

You can plan your own flights. To do this, use the command "Shedule Flight". Input a call sign of your flight, time of departure, select a country and an airport of departure and a country and an airport of arrival. That's all. When your flight starts you can follow it...

The function "camera"  allows the to be in the cockpit of the aircraft and enjoy the view from the cockpit, experience exciting feeling of landing, available only to pilots. To get on board of aircraft just input its callsign in the field "onboard" and open second browser window on the address "http://localhost:3000/html/cezium.html".

Soon you'll see other aircrafts from the cockpit. Stay tuned..
